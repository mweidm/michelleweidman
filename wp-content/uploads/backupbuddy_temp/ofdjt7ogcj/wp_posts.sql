Art that causes controversy is not new to SAIC. By now we all know the story of the Harold Washington painting by former SAIC student David Nelson and “What is the Proper Way to Display the U.S. Flag?” by Dread Scott Tyler. The school stood behind Tyler and suffered significant financial cuts in both government and private funding because of it. In both cases the work outraged communities outside SAIC. So, understandably, there is always concern around work that may be offensive or illegal.</p>\n<p>For what other reasons might the school request alterations? Now consider the case of Caroline Wayne, a  BFA candidate in the Fiber and Material Studies, whose work was altered during the course of the 2013 BFA exhibition, to protect, according to the school, her safety.</p>\n<p>Wayne’s specialties are soft sculpture and hat-making, which sound innocuous enough. However, Wayne’s work doesn’t stop at object creation; she is also interested in issues of intimacy and social interaction and how relationships are altered by technological innovation.</p>\n<p>Her contribution to the BFA exhibition, titled, “Was it Something I Said?” included a headpiece at the base of which was a phone number stitched in red thread underneath the provocation “text me.” When an audience member followed the instructions and texted the number, Wayne would respond by aggressively attempting to initiate a sexting conversation. She would also include a provocative image of herself with her face covered.</p>\n<p>Wayne took steps to ensure that her identity and personal contact information were obscured, including purchasing a burn phone and paying for one month of a pre-paid phone plan that she would use only for the duration of this project. She set guidelines for herself, including having no in-person contact with audience members and terminating all communication at the end of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>After the BFA exhibition opening, according to the school, an audience member complained after texting the number and receiving Wayne’s response. In reaction to the complaint, the school posted an audience warning next to the piece and spoke with Wayne during a meeting she had arranged with the Career and Co-op Center. During that meeting, Wayne; Kate Schutta, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and Co-director of the Career + Co-op Center; and Amy Dane Falkowski, Associate Dean of Budget and Administration discussed their concerns for Caroline’s personal safety. They asked Wayne to file a form with the school for approval of the work.</p>\n<p>F Newsmagazine met with Amy Dane Falkowski, who is involved in a new initiative at SAIC called Art School Considerations, as well as the Threat Assessment Group (TAG), which is why she was elected to meet with Wayne initially. She pointed out that Wayne’s identity was readily available online with an easy Internet search, which Falkowski considered the most serious concern.</p>\n<p>Art School Considerations (ASC) is a structure devised by the school, seemingly to avoid messy situations such as the Nelson and Tyler controversies mentioned above, but also to help students understand the potentially negative personal or ethical impact of their work. A poster that can be found around campus for the group features the motto, “It’s Not ‘No,’ ‘It’s How.’” Their list of items and situations that need prior approval includes foods, liquids and controlled substances; chemicals and hazardous materials; biomatter, bloodborne pathogens and organic materials; performances; weapons, structures and kinetics; electric and sound levels; alternative spaces; fire and safety; community and courtesy; anything you are unsure about. A formidable list.</p>\n<p>Still, Falkowski insisted that ASC is meant to help students, not hinder them. She offered examples of situations in which ASC aided students in the completion of their projects in a way that ensured their safety, as when a student wanted to climb the walls during an exhibition and the group helped determine the safest way for the student to accomplish that goal. Other than Wayne’s case, which was brought to ASC after the fact, Falkowski could only think of one situation in which a student’s proposal was denied, and that was because the student submitted it the day before the exhibition, not leaving adequate time to assure its safe execution.</p>\n<p>Wayne did not know about Art School Considerations before exhibiting “Was it Something I Said?” Falkowski said that if she had asked one of the Student Project Coordinators about the piece, they would have been able to find a way to make the project happen in a way that was acceptable for Wayne and the school.</p>\n<p>However, because it was too late to ensure complete anonymity for Wayne, ultimately her situation was brought to TAG and she was asked to remove the texting portion of her piece. “If we had had a conversation early on, we would have been able to make sure that she was covering all of her bases,” Falkowski said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the school asked for the SIM card of the prepaid phone that Wayne had been using to converse with participants. Although she agreed with all of the requests, Wayne still feels uncomfortable about the incident, and says she only handed over the phone in order to avoid a controversy so close to her graduation. “I did voice that I was uncomfortable with giving over my SIM card and letting them read through my conversations, to which they responded that they have the same right as they do to go through faculty’s e-mails,” Wayne explained.</p>\n<p>“There was an implied risk that I thought was important to demonstrate,” Wayne insists. “While the school has its concerns, I am over the age of 18 and feel that I should have had my opportunity to speak about the reality of virtual self-exploitation.”</p>\n<p>When asked what steps would have been taken if Wayne hadn’t agreed to alter her work, Falkowski explained that since it was primarily a student safety concern, Wayne’s emergency contacts would have been notified. “That would mean calling my parents, and as a 28-year-old that makes me a little uncomfortable. … I would certainly feel diminished and not trusted as an artist and an adult,” Wayne said.</p>\n<p>While it is too late for Wayne’s piece to be exhibited in full, this case highlights important tensions between acceptable risk at an educational institution. Art School Considerations seems to be trying to function in a gray area between unrestricted creation, vital for some art practices, and unacceptable hazards for an institution. This can become problematic in situations like Wayne’s when the hazard, to some degree, is the point. Additionally, repression of female sexuality and autonomy have long been restricted in the U.S. on the pretext of concern for a woman’s safety. The history of institutional and self-censorship in the arts, especially after the Culture Wars of the 1980s, makes it imperative that the reasons for altering work are thoroughly analyzed. Although censorship was not the school’s intention, careful analysis of the kinds of suggested changes and the real reasons behind those suggestions needs to be discussed.</p>\n<p>“I think it is important to think about why you are making the point you are when you make a work of art that may be controversial or polarizing,” Wayne said in partial support of the proposal process through Art School Consideration. “However, if we have earnest theory and plans for a piece, I believe it is the responsibility of an art school to let us be in control of our work and take the risks we should be taking as art students.”</p>\n<p>Undergraduate Lauren Wessel also often uses her own body in her performance, painting and photographic work. Wessel told F Newsmagazine that she sees both good and bad potential in the ASC process. “I wish something like that had been around when I was a freshman. I think it’s a good alternative to flat out telling people ‘No!’ to their project ideas.” Yet, she added, “If the procedure is meant to identify and dissuade students who might want to make transgressive work, I think it is hampering the art-making process. I know in the past I have been told I couldn’t make work that was in any way harmful to my own body. I think there should be a discussion with students who want to make work that is a ‘no-no’ about how and where that work can be made and displayed.”</p>\n			</div>\n					</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-text-column builder-text-column-2\" id=\"builder-section-1428719829688-column-2\">\n														</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-text-column builder-text-column-3\" id=\"builder-section-1428719829688-column-3\">\n														</div>\n			</div>\n</section>\n', 'Journalism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '40-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-11 02:55:20', '2015-04-11 02:55:20', '', '40', 'http://michelleweidman.com/40-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Other than Wayne’s case, which was brought to ASC after the fact, Falkowski could only think of one situation in which a student’s proposal was denied, and that was because the student submitted it the day before the exhibition, not leaving adequate time to assure its safe execution.</p>\n<p>Wayne did not know about Art School Considerations before exhibiting “Was it Something I Said?” Falkowski said that if she had asked one of the Student Project Coordinators about the piece, they would have been able to find a way to make the project happen in a way that was acceptable for Wayne and the school.</p>\n<p>However, because it was too late to ensure complete anonymity for Wayne, ultimately her situation was brought to TAG and she was asked to remove the texting portion of her piece. “If we had had a conversation early on, we would have been able to make sure that she was covering all of her bases,” Falkowski said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the school asked for the SIM card of the prepaid phone that Wayne had been using to converse with participants. Although she agreed with all of the requests, Wayne still feels uncomfortable about the incident, and says she only handed over the phone in order to avoid a controversy so close to her graduation. “I did voice that I was uncomfortable with giving over my SIM card and letting them read through my conversations, to which they responded that they have the same right as they do to go through faculty’s e-mails,” Wayne explained.</p>\n<p>“There was an implied risk that I thought was important to demonstrate,” Wayne insists. “While the school has its concerns, I am over the age of 18 and feel that I should have had my opportunity to speak about the reality of virtual self-exploitation.”</p>\n<p>When asked what steps would have been taken if Wayne hadn’t agreed to alter her work, Falkowski explained that since it was primarily a student safety concern, Wayne’s emergency contacts would have been notified. “That would mean calling my parents, and as a 28-year-old that makes me a little uncomfortable. … I would certainly feel diminished and not trusted as an artist and an adult,” Wayne said.</p>\n<p>While it is too late for Wayne’s piece to be exhibited in full, this case highlights important tensions between acceptable risk at an educational institution. Art School Considerations seems to be trying to function in a gray area between unrestricted creation, vital for some art practices, and unacceptable hazards for an institution. This can become problematic in situations like Wayne’s when the hazard, to some degree, is the point. Additionally, repression of female sexuality and autonomy have long been restricted in the U.S. on the pretext of concern for a woman’s safety. The history of institutional and self-censorship in the arts, especially after the Culture Wars of the 1980s, makes it imperative that the reasons for altering work are thoroughly analyzed. Although censorship was not the school’s intention, careful analysis of the kinds of suggested changes and the real reasons behind those suggestions needs to be discussed.</p>\n<p>“I think it is important to think about why you are making the point you are when you make a work of art that may be controversial or polarizing,” Wayne said in partial support of the proposal process through Art School Consideration. “However, if we have earnest theory and plans for a piece, I believe it is the responsibility of an art school to let us be in control of our work and take the risks we should be taking as art students.”</p>\n<p>Undergraduate Lauren Wessel also often uses her own body in her performance, painting and photographic work. Wessel told F Newsmagazine that she sees both good and bad potential in the ASC process. “I wish something like that had been around when I was a freshman. I think it’s a good alternative to flat out telling people ‘No!’ to their project ideas.” Yet, she added, “If the procedure is meant to identify and dissuade students who might want to make transgressive work, I think it is hampering the art-making process. I know in the past I have been told I couldn’t make work that was in any way harmful to my own body. I think there should be a discussion with students who want to make work that is a ‘no-no’ about how and where that work can be made and displayed.”</p>\n			</div>\n					</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-text-column builder-text-column-2\" id=\"builder-section-1428719829688-column-2\">\n														</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-text-column builder-text-column-3\" id=\"builder-section-1428719829688-column-3\">\n														</div>\n			</div>\n</section>\n', 'Journalism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '40-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-11 02:56:41', '2015-04-11 02:56:41', '', '40', 'http://michelleweidman.com/40-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

It is a commercial, filmed as the filming of a commercial, a tactical move that adds an illusion of authenticity and social reality. We are meant to believe that rather than being a commercial this video is about the behind the scenes real dialogue that informs the making of a traditional illusion-based representation. It starts with a female director asking adults to perform certain tasks “like a girl.” The ensuing performances are full of sissy hands, limp wrists, giggling, and generally incompetent body movements. Next the director asks a group of preadolescent girls to do the same actions. They, in turn, perform these actions as if they didn’t hear the “like a girl” qualifier. They throw hard balls. They run with vigor etc. The message is clear — these girls haven’t yet learned what it means to “be a girl.” The commercial is meant to be a message of empowerment, a call to arms of sorts asking U.S. society to start changing the explicit misogyny that destroys girls’ confidence in adolescence.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new call, this is not a new message, this is something that women have been attempting for decades, if not longer. Are we supposed to be touched that it has finally made it into mainstream dialogue? I think it might be time, rather, to look at this idea of confidence as an ideal. It has become a virtue in a nearly biblical sense, one of the commandments of a fulfilled life. Girls in America lose their confidence in puberty, we are told. Often with their confidence goes their chance at happiness, because happiness can only be achieved by attaining certain normalized measures of success. Sometimes it is mentioned that this is all due to the misogyny in our culture. However, what we are really telling girls is that once they have gone through puberty and lost their “confidence” they are, and should be (!), in a constant state of lack that requires a diligent quest of self-improvement and empowerment.\r\n\r\nIn “10 Ways Society Can Close the Confidence Gap” Soraya Chemaly notes, “The benchmark for this female loss of confidence is eternal male overconfidence, and that overconfidence has real costs….We know that overconfidence is an issue and that male disappointment in the face of unrealistic expectations is a big problem.” This isn’t just a female problem. And it also isn’t just a gendered problem — it is a racial and economic problem as well. It touches on the root of what is valued in our current political and economic system. Confidence is a golden calf.\r\n\r\nPersonal confidence and the idealization of confidence in a system are two different manifestations of a quality, but they are deeply codependent in U.S. culture. Still, equating them leads to a toxic critical stance regarding individual wholeness in the face of social ideals. This codependence manifests in articles like “The Confidence Gap” written by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman that reads as a topical solution to the problem of the lack of confidence in women rather than looking at what confidence is and how it perpetuates itself. This stance was beautifully refuted again by Chemaly in “10 Ways Society Can Close the Confidence Gap,” who points out that women’s confidence levels have much more to do with unexaggerated social inequalities than they do with an individual’s adequacy.\r\n\r\nI started developing an indignant attitude toward the idea of confidence as a valuable individual quality. Shouldn’t academics be constantly questioning their assumptions? Isn’t research and analysis based on an uncertainty about the world? Hasn’t the value of uncertainty been strengthened by studies of minor literature that had been sidelined for most of the history of the Western world? Not to mention the fact that uncertainty, about the economy, about the fate of the planet, about personal relationships, about the functioning of our governments, about anyone’s ability to do anything about any of it has been steadily on the increase for decades now? And even more than an individual quality, confidence has proven to be a detriment to contemporary American society and fuel for the capital system, evidenced most notably by the economic collapse of 2008.\r\n\r\nI do not want to suggest that we should deprive women of an increasing ability for success ,no matter how much I disagree personally with certain measures of success, they are all still things that we feel on an individual level and deeply effect lived experience. This is why I am equally wary of criticism that takes individual female empowerment as being in stark political opposition to feminism. We need to examine the facets of confidence to determine if they are really an ideal that we want to foster. Or, at the very least, are there ways to divorce the idea of confidence from their capitalistic and misogynistic histories and trajectories?\r\n\r\nIn “The Female Sociopath” Merve Emre associates female “sociopathy” with capitalist and male structures of success. Her main argument is against the valorization of sociopathy and the idea that individual women moving up the economic ladder is a sign of the success of feminism. While she spends a good amount of time in the article acknowledging the appeal of these kinds of depictions in opposition to the usual representation of women as victims her judgment is obvious, these are not feminist depictions, in fact, according to Emre, these ideals, as represented in these characters she lumps together, are anti-feminist.\r\n\r\nShe criticizes the rise of representations of female “sociopathy” in popular culture, particularly films and television shows such as <em>Girl with The Dragon Tattoo</em> and the upcoming release of the film adaptation of <em>Gone Girl</em>. This article, while not dealing with confidence specifically, is a good example of how these kinds of conversations around female behavior and social mores are being framed. We set up an opposition between varying kinds of behavior, be it passivity, nurturing tendencies, etc, against “go-getter” mentalities, then we deride the opposition while continuing to make judgments about what is good or bad feminist behavior.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things wrong with Emre’s account. First, she seems to flatten the relevance of the term sociopathy going so far as to apply it to Gillian Anderson’s character in <em>The Fall</em>. To her logic, any woman that is successful and resourceful in her career could fall into this category. Second, shouldn’t we know by now that representations are not a one-to-one correlation with lived experience? While Emre toys with the appeal of these representations she stops short of examining the ways that representation operates in society beyond a mirroring function. Just because we enjoy these characters and find some kind of affinity, or affective justice, in their actions does not mean that we want to be them or valorize their behavior in lived existence. Thirdly, Emre does not distinguish between confidence as an individual trait versus a social ideal and the different political implications each of these manifestations contain. Instead she derides these representations as being antithetical to some kind of progression of feminism:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The female sociopath wants to dominate these systems from within, as the most streamlined product of a world in which well-intentioned people blithely invoke words like arbitrage, leverage, capital, and currency to appraise how successfully we inhabit our bodies, our selves. One could easily imagine the female sociopath devouring books with titles like Bo$$ Bitch, Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office, The Confidence Gap, and Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman to hone her craft — to learn how to have it all. From atop the corporate ladder, she can applaud her liberation from the whole messy business of feeling as a step forward for women, when it’s really a step back.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe are caught in a no win situation measuring the appropriateness and desirability of personal characteristics. Woman should be confident and empathetic. They should be successful but kind. Or they should be ruthless and unforgiving — eventually, if we’re lucky, we may find the right combination of femaleness to blow the whole system out of the water. I’ll admit that often I forget which stance is in critical fashion at the moment, but, for the time being I hold my lack of confidence as a token of virtue, a signal of my shadowy identity in the face of so much illusory presence.', 'In Defense of Obstinate Lack', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'in-defense-of-obstinate-lack', '', '', '2015-06-13 05:21:36', '2015-06-13 05:21:36', '', '0', 'http://michelleweidman.com/?p=55', '0', 'post', '', '0');

We are meant to believe that rather than being a commercial this video is about the behind the scenes real dialogue that informs the making of a traditional illusion-based representation. It starts with a female director asking adults to perform certain tasks “like a girl.” The ensuing performances are full of sissy hands, limp wrists, giggling, and generally incompetent body movements. Next the director asks a group of preadolescent girls to do the same actions. They, in turn, perform these actions as if they didn’t hear the “like a girl” qualifier. They throw hard balls. They run with vigor etc. The message is clear — these girls haven’t yet learned what it means to “be a girl.” The commercial is meant to be a message of empowerment, a call to arms of sorts asking U.S. society to start changing the explicit misogyny that destroys girls’ confidence in adolescence.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new call, this is not a new message, this is something that women have been attempting for decades, if not longer. Are we supposed to be touched that it has finally made it into mainstream dialogue? I think it might be time, rather, to look at this idea of confidence as an ideal. It has become a virtue in a nearly biblical sense, one of the commandments of a fulfilled life. Girls in America lose their confidence in puberty, we are told. Often with their confidence goes their chance at happiness, because happiness can only be achieved by attaining certain normalized measures of success. Sometimes it is mentioned that this is all due to the misogyny in our culture. However, what we are really telling girls is that once they have gone through puberty and lost their “confidence” they are, and should be (!), in a constant state of lack that requires a diligent quest of self-improvement and empowerment.\r\n\r\nIn “10 Ways Society Can Close the Confidence Gap” Soraya Chemaly notes, “The benchmark for this female loss of confidence is eternal male overconfidence, and that overconfidence has real costs….We know that overconfidence is an issue and that male disappointment in the face of unrealistic expectations is a big problem.” This isn’t just a female problem. And it also isn’t just a gendered problem — it is a racial and economic problem as well. It touches on the root of what is valued in our current political and economic system. Confidence is a golden calf.\r\n\r\nPersonal confidence and the idealization of confidence in a system are two different manifestations of a quality, but they are deeply codependent in U.S. culture. Still, equating them leads to a toxic critical stance regarding individual wholeness in the face of social ideals. This codependence manifests in articles like “The Confidence Gap” written by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman that reads as a topical solution to the problem of the lack of confidence in women rather than looking at what confidence is and how it perpetuates itself.

Hasn’t the value of uncertainty been strengthened by studies of minor literature that had been sidelined for most of the history of the Western world? Not to mention the fact that uncertainty, about the economy, about the fate of the planet, about personal relationships, about the functioning of our governments, about anyone’s ability to do anything about any of it has been steadily on the increase for decades now?

In other words, confidence might be described as the tone of capitalism itself.’\r\n— Sianne Ngai, Ugly Feelings\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nConfidence is faith. It is a future leaning state, relying on some unseen past experience overlaid on future events with varying levels of arrogance. In short, confidence is a delusion. Yet, it continues to be an ideal in our economic systems, personal lives, and professional aspirations.\r\n\r\nIn <em>A Room of One’s Own</em> Woolf made some still-relevant points about the effect of material differences on the ability to perform and be successful in a realm of expertise. She outlined the gendered nature of artistic success and made progress in naming the causes for these discrepancies both materially and psychically. I read the above quote from A Room with a tinge of incredulity. Certainly it is true that much of what gets us through life, with or without applying a measurement of success, as Woolf suggests, is willful delusion.\r\n\r\nI have recently been watching and re-watching Maggie Estep’s performance of “Happy” on <em>Def Jam Poetry</em>. In the video Estep walks up to the standing mic and says, “This is called, Happy.” She pauses and looks down at her script as if mentally preparing for her read, but instead she begins with a preemptory guffaw. No one can read something called Happy in earnest, unless of course absurdly, they are. Happy is an ironically jubilant expression of gratitude and triumph. It finds its humor in its overabundance. Certainly someone expressing this much happiness has moved into some next-level delusion, some serious denial. And yet happiness, like confidence, is something that we all are told to, and often want, to achieve. This is not to say that we should inherently value a more negative or less optimistic (optimism is inherently tied to confidence) view of ourselves and the world. Unhappiness is not a valid political stance. In fact, no individual state is a valid political stance. But, these expressions, states of being, and emotions have political histories and manifest in lived experience in very political ways.\r\n\r\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUewhMJ4KFs&amp;amp;w=560&amp;amp;h=315]\r\n\r\nAlways’ #LikeAGirl is campaign launched by Always Feminine Products.

It is a future leaning state, relying on some unseen past experience overlaid on future events with varying levels of arrogance. In short, confidence is a delusion. Yet, it continues to be an ideal in our economic systems, personal lives, and professional aspirations.\r\n\r\nIn <em>A Room of One’s Own</em> Woolf made some still-relevant points about the effect of material differences on the ability to perform and be successful in a realm of expertise. She outlined the gendered nature of artistic success and made progress in naming the causes for these discrepancies both materially and psychically. I read the above quote from A Room with a tinge of incredulity. Certainly it is true that much of what gets us through life, with or without applying a measurement of success, as Woolf suggests, is willful delusion.\r\n\r\nI have recently been watching and re-watching Maggie Estep’s performance of “Happy” on <em>Def Jam Poetry</em>. In the video Estep walks up to the standing mic and says, “This is called, Happy.” She pauses and looks down at her script as if mentally preparing for her read, but instead she begins with a preemptory guffaw. No one can read something called Happy in earnest, unless of course absurdly, they are. Happy is an ironically jubilant expression of gratitude and triumph. It finds its humor in its overabundance. Certainly someone expressing this much happiness has moved into some next-level delusion, some serious denial. And yet happiness, like confidence, is something that we all are told to, and often want, to achieve. This is not to say that we should inherently value a more negative or less optimistic (optimism is inherently tied to confidence) view of ourselves and the world. Unhappiness is not a valid political stance. In fact, no individual state is a valid political stance. But, these expressions, states of being, and emotions have political histories and manifest in lived experience in very political ways.\r\n\r\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUewhMJ4KFs&amp;amp;w=560&amp;amp;h=315]\r\n\r\nAlways’ #LikeAGirl is campaign launched by Always Feminine Products. It is a commercial, filmed as the filming of a commercial, a tactical move that adds an illusion of authenticity and social reality. We are meant to believe that rather than being a commercial this video is about the behind the scenes real dialogue that informs the making of a traditional illusion-based representation. It starts with a female director asking adults to perform certain tasks “like a girl.” The ensuing performances are full of sissy hands, limp wrists, giggling, and generally incompetent body movements. Next the director asks a group of preadolescent girls to do the same actions. They, in turn, perform these actions as if they didn’t hear the “like a girl” qualifier. They throw hard balls. They run with vigor etc. The message is clear — these girls haven’t yet learned what it means to “be a girl.” The commercial is meant to be a message of empowerment, a call to arms of sorts asking U.S. society to start changing the explicit misogyny that destroys girls’ confidence in adolescence.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new call, this is not a new message, this is something that women have been attempting for decades, if not longer. Are we supposed to be touched that it has finally made it into mainstream dialogue? I think it might be time, rather, to look at this idea of confidence as an ideal. It has become a virtue in a nearly biblical sense, one of the commandments of a fulfilled life. Girls in America lose their confidence in puberty, we are told. Often with their confidence goes their chance at happiness, because happiness can only be achieved by attaining certain normalized measures of success. Sometimes it is mentioned that this is all due to the misogyny in our culture. However, what we are really telling girls is that once they have gone through puberty and lost their “confidence” they are, and should be (!), in a constant state of lack that requires a diligent quest of self-improvement and empowerment.\r\n\r\nIn “10 Ways Society Can Close the Confidence Gap” Soraya Chemaly notes, “The benchmark for this female loss of confidence is eternal male overconfidence, and that overconfidence has real costs….We know that overconfidence is an issue and that male disappointment in the face of unrealistic expectations is a big problem.” This isn’t just a female problem. And it also isn’t just a gendered problem — it is a racial and economic problem as well. It touches on the root of what is valued in our current political and economic system. Confidence is a golden calf.\r\n\r\nPersonal confidence and the idealization of confidence in a system are two different manifestations of a quality, but they are deeply codependent in U.S. culture. Still, equating them leads to a toxic critical stance regarding individual wholeness in the face of social ideals. This codependence manifests in articles like “The Confidence Gap” written by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman that reads as a topical solution to the problem of the lack of confidence in women rather than looking at what confidence is and how it perpetuates itself. This stance was beautifully refuted again by Chemaly in “10 Ways Society Can Close the Confidence Gap,” who points out that women’s confidence levels have much more to do with unexaggerated social inequalities than they do with an individual’s adequacy.\r\n\r\nI started developing an indignant attitude toward the idea of confidence as a valuable individual quality. Shouldn’t academics be constantly questioning their assumptions? Isn’t research and analysis based on an uncertainty about the world? Hasn’t the value of uncertainty been strengthened by studies of minor literature that had been sidelined for most of the history of the Western world? Not to mention the fact that uncertainty, about the economy, about the fate of the planet, about personal relationships, about the functioning of our governments, about anyone’s ability to do anything about any of it has been steadily on the increase for decades now? And even more than an individual quality, confidence has proven to be a detriment to contemporary American society and fuel for the capital system, evidenced most notably by the economic collapse of 2008.\r\n\r\nYet, I do not want to suggest that we should deprive women of an increasing ability for success ,no matter how much I disagree personally with certain measures of success, they are all still things that we feel on an individual level and deeply effect lived experience. This is why I am equally wary of criticism that takes individual female empowerment as being in stark political opposition to feminism. We need to examine the facets of confidence to determine if they are really an ideal that we want to foster. Or, at the very least, are there ways to divorce the idea of confidence from their capitalistic and misogynistic histories and trajectories?\r\n\r\nIn “The Female Sociopath” Merve Emre associates female “sociopathy” with capitalist and male structures of success. Her main argument is against the valorization of sociopathy and the idea that individual women moving up the economic ladder is a sign of the success of feminism. While she spends a good amount of time in the article acknowledging the appeal of these kinds of depictions in opposition to the usual representation of women as victims her judgment is obvious, these are not feminist depictions, in fact, according to Emre, these ideals, as represented in these characters she lumps together, are anti-feminist.\r\n\r\nShe criticizes the rise of representations of female “sociopathy” in popular culture, particularly films and television shows such as &lt;em&gt;Girl with The Dragon Tattoo&lt;/em&gt; and the upcoming release of the film adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;. This article, while not dealing with confidence specifically, is a good example of how these kinds of conversations around female behavior and social mores are being framed. We set up an opposition between varying kinds of behavior, be it passivity, nurturing tendencies, etc, against “go-getter” mentalities, then we deride the opposition while continuing to make judgments about what is good or bad feminist behavior.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things wrong with Emre’s account. First, she seems to flatten the relevance of the term sociopathy going so far as to apply it to Gillian Anderson’s character in &lt;em&gt;The Fall&lt;/em&gt;. To her logic, any woman that is successful and resourceful in her career could fall into this category. Second, shouldn’t we know by now that representations are not a one-to-one correlation with lived experience? While Emre toys with the appeal of these representations she stops short of examining the ways that representation operates in society beyond a mirroring function. Just because we enjoy these characters and find some kind of affinity, or affective justice, in their actions does not mean that we want to be them or valorize their behavior in lived existence. Thirdly, Emre does not distinguish between confidence as an individual trait versus a social ideal and the different political implications each of these manifestations contain. Instead she derides these representations as being antithetical to some kind of progression of feminism:\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;The female sociopath wants to dominate these systems from within, as the most streamlined product of a world in which well-intentioned people blithely invoke words like arbitrage, leverage, capital, and currency to appraise how successfully we inhabit our bodies, our selves. One could easily imagine the female sociopath devouring books with titles like Bo$$ Bitch, Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office, The Confidence Gap, and Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman to hone her craft — to learn how to have it all. From atop the corporate ladder, she can applaud her liberation from the whole messy business of feeling as a step forward for women, when it’s really a step back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\nWe are caught in a no win situation measuring the appropriateness and desirability of personal characteristics. Woman should be confident and empathetic. They should be successful but kind. Or they should be ruthless and unforgiving — eventually, if we’re lucky, we may find the right combination of femaleness to blow the whole system out of the water.

It is a commercial, filmed as the filming of a commercial, a tactical move that adds an illusion of authenticity and social reality. We are meant to believe that rather than being a commercial this video is about the behind the scenes real dialogue that informs the making of a traditional illusion-based representation. It starts with a female director asking adults to perform certain tasks “like a girl.” The ensuing performances are full of sissy hands, limp wrists, giggling, and generally incompetent body movements. Next the director asks a group of preadolescent girls to do the same actions. They, in turn, perform these actions as if they didn’t hear the “like a girl” qualifier. They throw hard balls. They run with vigor etc. The message is clear — these girls haven’t yet learned what it means to “be a girl.” The commercial is meant to be a message of empowerment, a call to arms of sorts asking U.S. society to start changing the explicit misogyny that destroys girls’ confidence in adolescence.</p>\n<p>This is not a new call, this is not a new message, this is something that women have been attempting for decades, if not longer. Are we supposed to be touched that it has finally made it into mainstream dialogue? I think it might be time, rather, to look at this idea of confidence as an ideal. It has become a virtue in a nearly biblical sense, one of the commandments of a fulfilled life. Girls in America lose their confidence in puberty, we are told. Often with their confidence goes their chance at happiness, because happiness can only be achieved by attaining certain normalized measures of success. Sometimes it is mentioned that this is all due to the misogyny in our culture. However, what we are really telling girls is that once they have gone through puberty and lost their “confidence” they are, and should be (!), in a constant state of lack that requires a diligent quest of self-improvement and empowerment.</p>\n<p>In “10 Ways Society Can Close the Confidence Gap” Soraya Chemaly notes, “The benchmark for this female loss of confidence is eternal male overconfidence, and that overconfidence has real costs….We know that overconfidence is an issue and that male disappointment in the face of unrealistic expectations is a big problem.” This isn’t just a female problem. And it also isn’t just a gendered problem — it is a racial and economic problem as well. It touches on the root of what is valued in our current political and economic system. Confidence is a golden calf.</p>\n<p>Personal confidence and the idealization of confidence in a system are two different manifestations of a quality, but they are deeply codependent in U.S. culture. Still, equating them leads to a toxic critical stance regarding individual wholeness in the face of social ideals. This codependence manifests in articles like “The Confidence Gap” written by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman that reads as a topical solution to the problem of the lack of confidence in women rather than looking at what confidence is and how it perpetuates itself. This stance was beautifully refuted again by Chemaly in “10 Ways Society Can Close the Confidence Gap,” who points out that women’s confidence levels have much more to do with unexaggerated social inequalities than they do with an individual’s adequacy.</p>\n<p>I started developing an indignant attitude toward the idea of confidence as a valuable individual quality. Shouldn’t academics be constantly questioning their assumptions? Isn’t research and analysis based on an uncertainty about the world? Hasn’t the value of uncertainty been strengthened by studies of minor literature that had been sidelined for most of the history of the Western world? Not to mention the fact that uncertainty, about the economy, about the fate of the planet, about personal relationships, about the functioning of our governments, about anyone’s ability to do anything about any of it has been steadily on the increase for decades now? And even more than an individual quality, confidence has proven to be a detriment to contemporary American society and fuel for the capital system, evidenced most notably by the economic collapse of 2008.</p>\n<p>I do not want to suggest that we should deprive women of an increasing ability for success ,no matter how much I disagree personally with certain measures of success, they are all still things that we feel on an individual level and deeply effect lived experience. This is why I am equally wary of criticism that takes individual female empowerment as being in stark political opposition to feminism. We need to examine the facets of confidence to determine if they are really an ideal that we want to foster. Or, at the very least, are there ways to divorce the idea of confidence from their capitalistic and misogynistic histories and trajectories?</p>\n<p>In “The Female Sociopath” Merve Emre associates female “sociopathy” with capitalist and male structures of success. Her main argument is against the valorization of sociopathy and the idea that individual women moving up the economic ladder is a sign of the success of feminism. While she spends a good amount of time in the article acknowledging the appeal of these kinds of depictions in opposition to the usual representation of women as victims her judgment is obvious, these are not feminist depictions, in fact, according to Emre, these ideals, as represented in these characters she lumps together, are anti-feminist.</p>\n<p>She criticizes the rise of representations of female “sociopathy” in popular culture, particularly films and television shows such as <em>Girl with The Dragon Tattoo</em> and the upcoming release of the film adaptation of <em>Gone Girl</em>. This article, while not dealing with confidence specifically, is a good example of how these kinds of conversations around female behavior and social mores are being framed. We set up an opposition between varying kinds of behavior, be it passivity, nurturing tendencies, etc, against “go-getter” mentalities, then we deride the opposition while continuing to make judgments about what is good or bad feminist behavior.</p>\n<p>There are a few things wrong with Emre’s account. First, she seems to flatten the relevance of the term sociopathy going so far as to apply it to Gillian Anderson’s character in <em>The Fall</em>. To her logic, any woman that is successful and resourceful in her career could fall into this category. Second, shouldn’t we know by now that representations are not a one-to-one correlation with lived experience? While Emre toys with the appeal of these representations she stops short of examining the ways that representation operates in society beyond a mirroring function. Just because we enjoy these characters and find some kind of affinity, or affective justice, in their actions does not mean that we want to be them or valorize their behavior in lived existence. Thirdly, Emre does not distinguish between confidence as an individual trait versus a social ideal and the different political implications each of these manifestations contain. Instead she derides these representations as being antithetical to some kind of progression of feminism:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The female sociopath wants to dominate these systems from within, as the most streamlined product of a world in which well-intentioned people blithely invoke words like arbitrage, leverage, capital, and currency to appraise how successfully we inhabit our bodies, our selves. One could easily imagine the female sociopath devouring books with titles like Bo$$ Bitch, Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office, The Confidence Gap, and Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman to hone her craft — to learn how to have it all. From atop the corporate ladder, she can applaud her liberation from the whole messy business of feeling as a step forward for women, when it’s really a step back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We are caught in a no win situation measuring the appropriateness and desirability of personal characteristics. Woman should be confident and empathetic. They should be successful but kind. Or they should be ruthless and unforgiving — eventually, if we’re lucky, we may find the right combination of femaleness to blow the whole system out of the water. I’ll admit that often I forget which stance is in critical fashion at the moment, but, for the time being I hold my lack of confidence as a token of virtue, a signal of my shadowy identity in the face of so much illusory presence.</p>\n					</div>\n									</div>\n			</div>\n					</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-gallery-item last-2\" onclick=\"return false;\">\n											</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-gallery-item last-3\" onclick=\"return false;\">\n											</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-gallery-item last-2\" onclick=\"return false;\">\n											</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-gallery-item\" onclick=\"return false;\">\n											</div>\n				<div class=\"builder-gallery-item last-3 last-2\" onclick=\"return false;\">\n											</div>\n			</div>\n	</section>\n', 'Art Writing', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '38-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-06-09 01:04:18', '2015-06-09 01:04:18', '', '38', 'http://michelleweidman.com/38-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Now consider the case of Caroline Wayne, a  BFA candidate in the Fiber and Material Studies, whose work was altered during the course of the 2013 BFA exhibition, to protect, according to the school, her safety.\r\n\r\nWayne’s specialties are soft sculpture and hat-making, which sound innocuous enough. However, Wayne’s work doesn’t stop at object creation; she is also interested in issues of intimacy and social interaction and how relationships are altered by technological innovation.\r\n\r\nHer contribution to the BFA exhibition, titled, “Was it Something I Said?” included a headpiece at the base of which was a phone number stitched in red thread underneath the provocation “text me.” When an audience member followed the instructions and texted the number, Wayne would respond by aggressively attempting to initiate a sexting conversation. She\r\nwould also include a provocative image of herself with her face covered.\r\n\r\nWayne took steps to ensure that her identity and personal contact information were obscured, including purchasing a burn phone and paying for one month of a pre-paid phone plan that she would use only for the duration of this project. She set guidelines for herself, including having no in-person contact with audience members and terminating all communication at the end of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nAfter the BFA exhibition opening, according to the school, an audience member complained after texting the number and receiving Wayne’s response. In reaction to the complaint, the school posted an audience warning next to the piece and spoke with Wayne during a meeting she had arranged with the Career and Co-op Center. During that meeting, Wayne; Kate Schutta, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and Co-director of the Career + Co-op Center; and Amy Dane Falkowski, Associate Dean of Budget and Administration discussed their concerns for Caroline’s personal safety. They asked Wayne to file a form with the school for approval of the work.\r\n\r\nF Newsmagazine met with Amy Dane Falkowski, who is involved in a new initiative at SAIC called Art School Considerations, as well as the Threat Assessment Group (TAG), which is why she was elected to meet with Wayne initially. She pointed out that Wayne’s identity was readily available online with an easy Internet search, which Falkowski considered the most serious concern.\r\n\r\nArt School Considerations (ASC) is a structure devised by the school, seemingly to avoid messy situations such as the Nelson and Tyler controversies mentioned above, but also to help students understand the potentially negative personal or ethical impact of their work. A poster that can be found around campus for the group features the motto, “It’s Not ‘No,’ ‘It’s How.’” Their list of items and situations that need prior approval includes foods, liquids and controlled substances; chemicals and hazardous materials; biomatter, bloodborne pathogens and organic materials; performances; weapons, structures and kinetics; electric and sound levels; alternative spaces; fire and safety; community and courtesy; anything you are unsure about. A formidable list.\r\n\r\nStill, Falkowski insisted that ASC is meant to help students, not hinder them. She offered examples of situations in which ASC aided students in the completion of their projects in a way that ensured their safety, as when a student wanted to climb the walls during an exhibition and the group helped determine the safest way for the student to accomplish that goal. Other than Wayne’s case, which was brought to ASC after the fact, Falkowski could only think of one situation in which a student’s proposal was denied, and that was because the student submitted it the day before the exhibition, not leaving adequate time to assure its safe execution.\r\n\r\nWayne did not know about Art School Considerations before exhibiting “Was it Something I Said?” Falkowski said that if she had asked one of the Student Project Coordinators about the piece, they would have been able to find a way to make the project happen in a way that was acceptable for Wayne and the school.\r\n\r\nHowever, because it was too late to ensure complete anonymity for Wayne, ultimately her situation was brought to TAG and she was asked to remove the texting portion of her piece. “If we had had a conversation early on, we would have been able to make sure that she was covering all of her bases,” Falkowski said.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the school asked for the SIM card of the prepaid phone that Wayne had been using to converse with participants. Although she agreed with all of the requests, Wayne still feels uncomfortable about the incident, and says she only handed over the phone in order to avoid a controversy so close to her graduation. “I did voice that I was uncomfortable with giving over my SIM card and letting them read through my conversations, to which they responded that they have the same right as they do to go through faculty’s e-mails,” Wayne explained.\r\n\r\n“There was an implied risk that I thought was important to demonstrate,” Wayne insists. “While the school has its concerns, I am over the age of 18 and feel that I should have had my opportunity to speak about the reality of virtual self-exploitation.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked what steps would have been taken if Wayne hadn’t agreed to alter her work, Falkowski explained that since it was primarily a student safety concern, Wayne’s emergency contacts would have been notified. “That would mean calling my parents, and as a 28-year-old that makes me a little uncomfortable. … I would certainly feel diminished and not trusted as an artist and an adult,” Wayne said.\r\n\r\nWhile it is too late for Wayne’s piece to be exhibited in full, this case highlights important tensions between acceptable risk at an educational institution. Art School Considerations seems to be trying to function in a gray area between unrestricted creation, vital for some art practices, and unacceptable hazards for an institution. This can become problematic in situations like Wayne’s when the hazard, to some degree, is the point. Additionally, repression of female sexuality and autonomy have long been restricted in the U.S. on the pretext of concern for a woman’s safety. The history of institutional and self-censorship in the arts, especially after the Culture Wars of the 1980s, makes it imperative that the reasons for altering work are thoroughly analyzed. Although censorship was not the school’s intention, careful analysis of the kinds of suggested changes and the real reasons behind those suggestions needs to be discussed.\r\n\r\nCaroline Wayne, “Was it Something I Said?” Photos courtesy of the artist.\r\n\r\n“I think it is important to think about why you are making the point you are when you make a work of art that may be controversial or polarizing,” Wayne said in partial support of the proposal process through Art School Consideration. “However, if we have earnest theory and plans for a piece, I believe it is the responsibility of an art school to let us be in control of our work and take the risks we should be taking as art students.”\r\n\r\nUndergraduate Lauren Wessel also often uses her own body in her performance, painting and photographic work. Wessel told F Newsmagazine that she sees both good and bad potential in the ASC process. “I wish something like that had been around when I was a freshman. I think it’s a good alternative to flat out telling people ‘No!’ to their project ideas.” Yet, she added, “If the procedure is meant to identify and dissuade students who might want to make transgressive work, I think it is hampering the art-making process. I know in the past I have been told I couldn’t make work that was in any way harmful to my own body. I think there should be a discussion with students who want to make work that is a ‘no-no’ about how and where that work can be made and displayed.”', 'Risk Assessment', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', '77', '', '', '2015-06-13 05:35:29', '2015-06-13 05:35:29', '', '0', 'http://michelleweidman.com/?p=77', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Each year SFS determines how much students are expected to spend on indirect educational costs, and this year they decided previous estimates were too high. Reducing these amounts can decrease the total amount of loans necessary to cover these expenses.\r\n\r\nFor example, the estimated cost for books and supplies for a graduate student in a studio program in 2011-2012 was $1370; for 2012-2013 it is $855. SFS also reduced their estimates for all other categories including personal, transportation, and room and board for all students (see infographic for the total amount that indirect educational expenses have been reduced for all students).\r\n\r\nThe decreases cannot be attributed to an actual decrease in the cost of living. According to the Consumer Price Index, the cost of living in the Chicago area has increased by 1.1 percent since July 2011. This year SFS adjusted the estimates based solely on a student survey they conducted October 2011.\r\n\r\n“Our tuition is comparable, give or take, to our peers, but our cost of attendance was significantly higher,” Rose Milkowski, Vice President of Enrollment Management, told F Newsmagazine. “Part of that is because Chicago is an expensive place to live, but our estimates for certain categories like books and supplies seemed disproportionate.\r\n\r\nIn order to gauge the accuracy of their previous estimates, SFS surveyed 1700 undergraduate students and received about a 33% response rate. “The student responses actually would have decreased [the indirect educational costs] more, but we thought that was drastic and would have impacted their loan availability, so we went on the very high end of student responses,” Milkowski explained.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://michelleweidman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/13.jpg\"><img src=\"http://michelleweidman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/13.jpg\" alt=\"13\" width=\"676\" height=\"2963\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIf SAIC’s estimates were previously higher than the estimates of other institutions, they are now significantly lower. F Newsmagazine looked at indirect expenses from The Rhode Island School of Design, California College of the Arts, Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Loyola University and The University of Chicago. Pratt Institute was at the high end with $9250 allocated for indirect educational costs for off-campus undergraduate students and Loyola at the low end with $7410. For an SAIC student, it is now $6395, which is lower than the estimates made in 2009, according to student budgeting worksheets distributed by SFS.\r\n\r\nDespite these differences, Milkowski emphasized, “[For] any student who struggles with that cost of attendance and can justify that they have to spend more, we can always make adjustments for them, no problem. If any students are greatly impacted they should talk to their financial services counselor and go through the process of extending their cost of attendance, for special cases.”\r\n\r\n“Colleges and universities are given wide flexibility in how they determine the component parts that make up cost of attendance,” said Rachel Fishman, a policy analyst for the Education Policy Program for the New America Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy institute. “There is no regulation that specifies exactly how it’s calculated — just what needs to be reported.”\r\n\r\nF Newsmagazine spoke with Fishman in order to get a better understanding of how the cost of attendance is determined and what effect it can have on individual students.

If any students are greatly impacted they should talk to their financial services counselor and go through the process of extending their cost of attendance, for special cases.”\r\n\r\n“Colleges and universities are given wide flexibility in how they determine the component parts that make up cost of attendance,” said Rachel Fishman, a policy analyst for the Education Policy Program for the New America Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy institute. “There is no regulation that specifies exactly how it’s calculated — just what needs to be reported.”\r\n\r\nF Newsmagazine spoke with Fishman in order to get a better understanding of how the cost of attendance is determined and what effect it can have on individual students. She confirmed that reducing the cost of attendance could potentially reduce the amount of aid offered to students.\r\n\r\nFinAid.org, an award-winning nonpartisan site dedicated to providing “comprehensive and objective” information about financial aid in the United States, offers further insight into institutional reasons for lowering the indirect educational cost estimates. According to the website, “Some schools deliberately keep the student budget artificially low, since prospective students often use cost of attendance to compare competing schools.”\r\n\r\nThe website provides another reason, “The school might also use a lower standard student budget to discourage overborrowing by students. Students who have basic expenses beyond those specified by the budget are forced to ask for an increase.”\r\n\r\nFishman pointed out that according to the Project on Student Debt, SAIC has the highest average debt for 2010 graduates in all of Illinois at $39,306, with 50% of students graduating with debt. This is well above the the national average which is $25,250.\r\n\r\n“It looks like student defaults on loans have been rising slightly,” She said. “The two year default rate on federal student loans for SAIC is 6.9%. Schools don’t want their defaults to get too high, because if they do, they could face serious sanctions, like losing Title IV aid eligibility, but SAIC is nowhere near [losing their eligibility].”\r\n\r\nDecreasing the cost of attendance and, consequently, student debt may be a positive change for SAIC and its students if the new estimates accurately reflect student spending. But the verdict is still out on how much the changes will affect current and future students. The method chosen to lower the cost of attendance, however, highlights a systemic problem with the cost of higher education and a seeming inability to curb ever-increasing tuition and fees.', 'Cash Back — What Will Your Refund Look Like?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '82-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-06-14 22:49:49', '2015-06-14 22:49:49', '', '82', 'http://michelleweidman.com/82-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

The video, composed of a single shot, was mostly filled with dense foliage. The only action in the frame was the face and shoulders of the artist and an anonymous hand, presumably male, which alternated between gently caressing and brutally pulling the woman’s hair. The barely on-scene face of the artist was continuously forced down to the bottom edge of the projection where it threatened to disappear from view altogether. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Her facial expression hinted at moments of anguish interspersed in dull acceptance. The combination of the composition of the shot and the incomprehensible position of the figures made the dynamics of the interaction nearly illegible. The question that the video poses became who or what is being controlled and what is the nature of the power being exerted.</p>\n<p>The initial connection that I made when viewing the video was with Andy Warhol’s “Blow Job” that was recently on view in an edited form at Reed College’s <a href=\"http://www.reed.edu/gallery/\">Cooley gallery</a>. What connects these videos is the ambiguity of the off screen action and frustrating uncertainty of the mental and physical state of the onscreen subject. In “Blow Job,” the implication of a sex act is frustrated by the inability of the viewer to visually verify and therefore participate in the act itself, as is presumably the goal in pornographic imagery. With the title “Dominion,” Lichau implies a power structure and some brand of struggle but gives few further cues into the dynamics or cause of the interaction. In the same way that Warhol frustrates the pleasure seeking ability of the pornographic viewer Lichau frustrates the viewers ability to sympathize and/or identify with the figures in the video. Rather than being able to assume a role in, or participate in the narrative of the power struggle one is left searching for hints of pleasure and pain that would allow for the assumption or prescription of a binary power relationship. It is precisely this disavowal that gives “Dominion” its power.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_14\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Film still from “Blow Job,” Andy Warhol, 1963.\"]<a href=\"http://weidmanm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/warhol1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14\" title=\"warhol1\" src=\"http://weidmanm.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/warhol1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"207\" /></a>[/caption]</p>\n<p>Originally published on August 24, 2010 at <a href=\"ultrapdx.com\">Ultrapdx.com</a>.

But in undergrad, I considered myself a photographer, and most of the work I made and was interested in was photographic. ... It was still a sort of roundabout path: I was a radical cheerleader, I was in a band, I had several dance troupes, but all of those experiences really shaped the kind of performance artist I am today, and gave me a pretty awesome and specific skill set, most especially with regards to audience. \r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThat of course is the reason that I perform, the immediacy of existing live within my art with my audience. Although many times when I am just about to perform (in a group show, for example) I look around ruefully and wonder “Why didn’t I just make a painting? I could be standing around, casually talking to my friends instead of about to make my art in front of everyone.” But since I tend to be so fascinated by control, as well as a certain lack of it, I enjoy setting myself up for the unexpected situations that are inherent in performance art.</strong>\r\n\r\nMichelle Weidman:  Some themes that come to mind when I think of your work are spectacle and performativity not just in a theatrical sense but also in relation to representations of femininity in popular culture.  What do you consider to be your main interests thematically? What are you addressing with your current work?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: One of the themes that I find coming up again and again in my practice is the notion of power, and of control. Sometimes that is set up in a sort of binary opposition, and sometimes it is more subtle and shifting. I think that what I am often attempting to do is to occupy that liminal space, or to set up a situation that appears at first glance to be a traditional binary power dynamic, but becomes surprisingly fluid upon closer examination. I think that placing a woman/women in a position of power is an inherently feminist gesture. I also want to articulate that I do not see vulnerability as weakness, or as the opposite of power. I think that allowing oneself to be vulnerable within a performance can in fact be a supremely potent position. My new life motto is a re-appropriation of the “NO FEAR” tagline of the 90s extreme sports clothing brand/lifestyle. However, I want to amend that to note that it doesn’t mean that one cannot feel afraid, but to remind oneself not to live and act in fear. I am currently working on making a motivational poster of this mantra!</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: Your work reflects an interest in feminism, popular culture, and “high” art. How do you view/navigate these fields? What do you consider to be your relation to each of them?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: I work in the academy, I went to art school, I have an MFA: I am deeply entrenched in the world of high art. And I love it, because I LOVE art, I am lucky enough to have been exposed to it at a young and impressionable age I suppose, and this is the kind of culture that I am interested in looking at, and learning about, and seeking out. However, I also live in the world, and specifically in the US, and pop culture is everywhere. I am not so much of an academic that I spend my days and nights locked up in some ivory tower poring over books, I like to go to the club!  My pop culture interests dovetail with my art interests, which is reflective of a certain corner of the art world — <a href=\"http://kanyewest.com/\">Kanye West</a> collaborating with <a href=\"http://www.vanessabeecroft.com/\">Vanessa Beecroft</a>. Not that that is an exact perfect storm of the interests of my practice, in terms of making I am more excited about conflating sissy bounce with minimalism.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: Who are some of your popular culture influences?  Who are some of your artistic influences? Are they mutually exclusive? Do you feel like they impact you in different ways?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: <a href=\"http://www.r-kelly.com/\">R. KELLY</a>, #1 influence, pop culturally and artistically, I see no difference. <a href=\"http://www.adrianpiper.com/\">Adrian Piper</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wynnegreenwood.com/\">Wynne Greenwood</a> (as Tracy &amp; the Plastics), <a href=\"http://www.kaluplinzy.net/\">Kalup Linzy</a>, <a href=\"http://hennessyyoungman.bandcamp.com/\">Hennessey Youngman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/awc/marina-abramovic.html\">Marina Abramovic</a>, <a href=\"http://prince.org/\">Prince</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lttr.org/\">LTTR</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eai.org/artistTitles.htm?id=450\">Alex Bag</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0648780/\">Yoko Ono</a>, <a href=\"http://www.yayoi-kusama.jp/e/information/index.html\">Yayoi Kusama</a>, <a href=\"http://bigfreedia.com/\">Big Freedia</a>, etc. There are so many. I don’t know if they impact me in different ways, I mean, of course, they must, right? But I don’t really feel compelled to sort them out in any particular way, except perhaps thematically: who inspires me conceptually, who inspires me performatively?</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: You incorporate a lot of choreography in your work. Is it the process of choreography and instruction that interests you or is it just a necessary component of some of your finished performances?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: Although I love performing choreographed movement, I don’t really care so much about teaching it, that is not where my interests lie. It is more of a means to an end. I need to use a lot of additional performers in some of my projects, so I think that there is a real comfort to having the framework of choreography to fall back on, especially for people who are shy or less outgoing performers. However, I do think that there is something particularly satisfying about seeing choreographed movement in a large group. I especially like to see what happens when movements are filtered through the performers’ individual physical vocabularies, it is like becoming aware of the nuances of a text through reading different translations.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: You have mentioned before that you do not tape your performances. Are there tactical reasons for that decision or is it an aesthetic choice, or both?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: I think that asking/demanding that a performance artist document their work through video is patently unfair. No one would ask a painter to make two paintings simultaneously! Making a compelling video document of a performance requires just as much, if not more choreography and planning as making the piece, and there is always the fear that it might fail (which is much different from having the piece fail). For a long time I subscribed to the popular belief that all that matters in the end is having impressive video documentation. This caused me no end of stress, and was ultimately distracting to the performance, as I found myself performing to the camera, rather than the audience. Plus, although we become more and more sophistical of a viewing audience, people still forget that the video is not the performance, and respond that a performance is “boring,” when in fact what they mean is that the video is “boring.” I find that using still photographs circumvents this situation, and satiates the desire to see the performance. Of course I have to say that the most ideal situation is to actually JUST COME TO THE PERFORMANCE, DUH</strong>.\r\n\r\nMW: Most of your work that I have seen first hand, which admittedly isn’t as much as I would like, has utilized the standard separation between artist and audience but I know that you have other performances, perhaps more recent, that deal with direct contact with the audience. Is this a new development in your work or is it something you have always been engaged with/interested in?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: I am always interested in engagement with the audience. Sometimes it makes sense to have that engagement reside in a more traditional separation between myself and the audience, though even when that is the case I like to blur these lines as much as possible. Recently I have been investigating super intimate experiences between myself and an individual audience member, which mixes it up a little more. But I am curious about boundaries, and probably with testing them, though that seems sort of dangerous to admit. I am drawn to intensity of experience, and since I think that I have recently become straight-edge again (???), I like to think of “getting CRAZY, like PARRRRRRTAAAAAAAAAYYYY!!!” as a sort of emotional wildin’ out, but in a respectful way.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: You recently wrote an impassioned and attentive analysis of R. Kelly’s work and artistic intentions for the publication <a href=\"http://ya5ya5.tumblr.com/\">YA5</a>. Would you say that you idolize R. Kelly? Do you address idolization in your artistic practice?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: First off, I think that it is important to state that my intellectual interest in R. Kelly is for his artistic output, I am going to take the privileged critical position of ignoring R. Kelly, the man, in order to concentrate on the work of R. Kelly, the artist. And actually, this is not the first time that I have been asked about idolizing him, someone once asked me if what I actually wanted was to be him, which was a shocking suggestion to me. Because no, I don’t want to be him! I am happy and grateful that his deeply weird mind exists, and I am fascinated with how he understands the world, but I am not at interested in having that mind! I want that mind to exist externally from me so that I can appreciate it. I do find R. Kelly to be an inspiration, and I want to collaborate with him, but I don’t think that I would characterize my feelings as idolization.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: Do you consider writing to be an integral part of your work?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: I am not sure. I love language, and I like the way that my writing practice allows me a space for critical unpacking, but it is such a different kind of output from my visual work. I think that it runs on a parallel track, but it also feels pretty distinct for me.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: Additionally, you have started curating an ongoing performance exhibition. Do you consider curatorial practices to be an integral part of your work?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: No, my curatorial project (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002670023662\">5TH WEDNESDAYS</a>) is just a pet project for me, a way of creating the community I want to exist within, and getting/giving the opportunity to see more of the art that I am most interested in. Outside of TBA, there are not a lot of venues for performance art in this city, and I am sorry, but 11 days in a year is not enough! I have a lot of respect for people who want to take on curating -- it’s a difficult practice, there is a reason that people go to school for that shit! I find the administration aspect frustrating to the extreme.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: You are currently traveling in the mid west for work and pleasure. Will you tell me a bit about the work you will be performing over the summer?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: Weird witch work.

It was still a sort of roundabout path: I was a radical cheerleader, I was in a band, I had several dance troupes, but all of those experiences really shaped the kind of performance artist I am today, and gave me a pretty awesome and specific skill set, most especially with regards to audience. \r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThat of course is the reason that I perform, the immediacy of existing live within my art with my audience. Although many times when I am just about to perform (in a group show, for example) I look around ruefully and wonder “Why didn’t I just make a painting? I could be standing around, casually talking to my friends instead of about to make my art in front of everyone.” But since I tend to be so fascinated by control, as well as a certain lack of it, I enjoy setting myself up for the unexpected situations that are inherent in performance art.</strong>\r\n\r\nMichelle Weidman:  Some themes that come to mind when I think of your work are spectacle and performativity not just in a theatrical sense but also in relation to representations of femininity in popular culture.  What do you consider to be your main interests thematically? What are you addressing with your current work?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: One of the themes that I find coming up again and again in my practice is the notion of power, and of control. Sometimes that is set up in a sort of binary opposition, and sometimes it is more subtle and shifting. I think that what I am often attempting to do is to occupy that liminal space, or to set up a situation that appears at first glance to be a traditional binary power dynamic, but becomes surprisingly fluid upon closer examination. I think that placing a woman/women in a position of power is an inherently feminist gesture. I also want to articulate that I do not see vulnerability as weakness, or as the opposite of power. I think that allowing oneself to be vulnerable within a performance can in fact be a supremely potent position. My new life motto is a re-appropriation of the “NO FEAR” tagline of the 90s extreme sports clothing brand/lifestyle. However, I want to amend that to note that it doesn’t mean that one cannot feel afraid, but to remind oneself not to live and act in fear. I am currently working on making a motivational poster of this mantra!</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: Your work reflects an interest in feminism, popular culture, and “high” art. How do you view/navigate these fields? What do you consider to be your relation to each of them?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: I work in the academy, I went to art school, I have an MFA: I am deeply entrenched in the world of high art. And I love it, because I LOVE art, I am lucky enough to have been exposed to it at a young and impressionable age I suppose, and this is the kind of culture that I am interested in looking at, and learning about, and seeking out. However, I also live in the world, and specifically in the US, and pop culture is everywhere. I am not so much of an academic that I spend my days and nights locked up in some ivory tower poring over books, I like to go to the club!  My pop culture interests dovetail with my art interests, which is reflective of a certain corner of the art world — <a href=\"http://kanyewest.com/\">Kanye West</a> collaborating with <a href=\"http://www.vanessabeecroft.com/\">Vanessa Beecroft</a>. Not that that is an exact perfect storm of the interests of my practice, in terms of making I am more excited about conflating sissy bounce with minimalism.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: Who are some of your popular culture influences?  Who are some of your artistic influences? Are they mutually exclusive? Do you feel like they impact you in different ways?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: <a href=\"http://www.r-kelly.com/\">R. KELLY</a>, #1 influence, pop culturally and artistically, I see no difference. <a href=\"http://www.adrianpiper.com/\">Adrian Piper</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wynnegreenwood.com/\">Wynne Greenwood</a> (as Tracy &amp; the Plastics), <a href=\"http://www.kaluplinzy.net/\">Kalup Linzy</a>, <a href=\"http://hennessyyoungman.bandcamp.com/\">Hennessey Youngman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/awc/marina-abramovic.html\">Marina Abramovic</a>, <a href=\"http://prince.org/\">Prince</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lttr.org/\">LTTR</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eai.org/artistTitles.htm?id=450\">Alex Bag</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0648780/\">Yoko Ono</a>, <a href=\"http://www.yayoi-kusama.jp/e/information/index.html\">Yayoi Kusama</a>, <a href=\"http://bigfreedia.com/\">Big Freedia</a>, etc. There are so many. I don’t know if they impact me in different ways, I mean, of course, they must, right? But I don’t really feel compelled to sort them out in any particular way, except perhaps thematically: who inspires me conceptually, who inspires me performatively?</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: You incorporate a lot of choreography in your work. Is it the process of choreography and instruction that interests you or is it just a necessary component of some of your finished performances?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: Although I love performing choreographed movement, I don’t really care so much about teaching it, that is not where my interests lie. It is more of a means to an end. I need to use a lot of additional performers in some of my projects, so I think that there is a real comfort to having the framework of choreography to fall back on, especially for people who are shy or less outgoing performers. However, I do think that there is something particularly satisfying about seeing choreographed movement in a large group. I especially like to see what happens when movements are filtered through the performers’ individual physical vocabularies, it is like becoming aware of the nuances of a text through reading different translations.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: You have mentioned before that you do not tape your performances. Are there tactical reasons for that decision or is it an aesthetic choice, or both?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: I think that asking/demanding that a performance artist document their work through video is patently unfair. No one would ask a painter to make two paintings simultaneously! Making a compelling video document of a performance requires just as much, if not more choreography and planning as making the piece, and there is always the fear that it might fail (which is much different from having the piece fail). For a long time I subscribed to the popular belief that all that matters in the end is having impressive video documentation. This caused me no end of stress, and was ultimately distracting to the performance, as I found myself performing to the camera, rather than the audience. Plus, although we become more and more sophistical of a viewing audience, people still forget that the video is not the performance, and respond that a performance is “boring,” when in fact what they mean is that the video is “boring.” I find that using still photographs circumvents this situation, and satiates the desire to see the performance. Of course I have to say that the most ideal situation is to actually JUST COME TO THE PERFORMANCE, DUH</strong>.\r\n\r\nMW: Most of your work that I have seen first hand, which admittedly isn’t as much as I would like, has utilized the standard separation between artist and audience but I know that you have other performances, perhaps more recent, that deal with direct contact with the audience. Is this a new development in your work or is it something you have always been engaged with/interested in?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: I am always interested in engagement with the audience. Sometimes it makes sense to have that engagement reside in a more traditional separation between myself and the audience, though even when that is the case I like to blur these lines as much as possible. Recently I have been investigating super intimate experiences between myself and an individual audience member, which mixes it up a little more. But I am curious about boundaries, and probably with testing them, though that seems sort of dangerous to admit. I am drawn to intensity of experience, and since I think that I have recently become straight-edge again (???), I like to think of “getting CRAZY, like PARRRRRRTAAAAAAAAAYYYY!!!” as a sort of emotional wildin’ out, but in a respectful way.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: You recently wrote an impassioned and attentive analysis of R. Kelly’s work and artistic intentions for the publication <a href=\"http://ya5ya5.tumblr.com/\">YA5</a>. Would you say that you idolize R. Kelly? Do you address idolization in your artistic practice?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: First off, I think that it is important to state that my intellectual interest in R. Kelly is for his artistic output, I am going to take the privileged critical position of ignoring R. Kelly, the man, in order to concentrate on the work of R. Kelly, the artist. And actually, this is not the first time that I have been asked about idolizing him, someone once asked me if what I actually wanted was to be him, which was a shocking suggestion to me. Because no, I don’t want to be him! I am happy and grateful that his deeply weird mind exists, and I am fascinated with how he understands the world, but I am not at interested in having that mind! I want that mind to exist externally from me so that I can appreciate it. I do find R. Kelly to be an inspiration, and I want to collaborate with him, but I don’t think that I would characterize my feelings as idolization.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: Do you consider writing to be an integral part of your work?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: I am not sure. I love language, and I like the way that my writing practice allows me a space for critical unpacking, but it is such a different kind of output from my visual work. I think that it runs on a parallel track, but it also feels pretty distinct for me.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: Additionally, you have started curating an ongoing performance exhibition. Do you consider curatorial practices to be an integral part of your work?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: No, my curatorial project (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002670023662\">5TH WEDNESDAYS</a>) is just a pet project for me, a way of creating the community I want to exist within, and getting/giving the opportunity to see more of the art that I am most interested in. Outside of TBA, there are not a lot of venues for performance art in this city, and I am sorry, but 11 days in a year is not enough! I have a lot of respect for people who want to take on curating -- it’s a difficult practice, there is a reason that people go to school for that shit! I find the administration aspect frustrating to the extreme.</strong>\r\n\r\nMW: You are currently traveling in the mid west for work and pleasure. Will you tell me a bit about the work you will be performing over the summer?\r\n\r\n<strong>AH: Weird witch work.
